    <h1>Whoami:</h1>
    <p>
Cybersecurity enthusiast in constant searching for new challenges to improve my practical skills as well as theoreticians. I have extensive experience in areas such as Threat Hunting, Threat Intelligence & DFIR, which has allowed me to participate in critical high-value instances, thus driving the obtaining of new knowledge in key areas such as threat modeling, identification of malicious actors, adversary simulation, analysis of large volumes of data, etc.<br><br>

On the other hand, within my free time I am enthusiastic about exploring new places whether natural or urban, I am also passionate about technical literature and Watakushi-shōsetsu, in addition to enjoying both the vinyl and music collection in all its formats along with strategy video games or MMORPG.<br><br>
